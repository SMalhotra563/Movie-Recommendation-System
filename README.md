# Movie-Recommendation-System

A movie recommendation system, also known as a movie recommender system, leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast or filter users' movie preferences. This is achieved by analyzing and understanding their past decisions and interactions within the movie-watching domain. The system processes data such as users' historical movie selections, ratings, genres of interest, and other relevant behavioral patterns. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, the movie recommendation system aims to provide personalized suggestions that align with the individual tastes and preferences of users. This predictive and filtering mechanism enhances the overall user experience by offering tailored recommendations, thereby helping users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on their prior decisions and actions in the realm of film consumption.
